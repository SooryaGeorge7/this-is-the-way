## USER EXPERIENCE

### USER STORIES
As a user I would like:
* Clear and concise instructions for the game
* To have consistent feedback on my progress throughout the game (e.g. lives remaining)
* To be able to move Grogu intuitively through the map
* A fun and original game experience with Madolorian music and imagery
* Functionality to turn the music on/off


### DESIGN
We took inspiration for our color scheme from the planet Tatooine (specifically its iconic binary sunset!). Using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) we extracted a theme based on this image:

![Movie still from the movie Star Wars IV: A New Hope](/assets/images/syfy_image.jpg)

The following colors were selected:
- ![#8C6175](https://placehold.co/15x15/8C6175/8C6175.png) Purple 
- ![#40342d](https://placehold.co/15x15/40342d/40342d.png) Brown
- ![#ef554b](https://placehold.co/15x15/ef554b/ef554b.png) Orange
- ![#a6695b](https://placehold.co/15x15/a6695b/a6695b.png) Camel
- ![#a66868](https://placehold.co/15x15/a66868/a66868.png) Dusty Pink

We cross referenced the colors using [Eight Shapes](www.https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to test the contrast and made sure we used readable combinations throughout the website.

#### COLOUR SCHEME

#### TYPOGRAPHY

The Mandalorian font is well recogised for its distinctive strong angles and cutout of the Mandalorian in the character A.

We sourced the font Mandalore from [dafonts](https://www.dafont.com/mandalore.font) and then converted the font to a WebFont Kit to allow the font to be used on our site using [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/).

To make the heading 'pop' we have styled it using the text-shadow attribute in the css which gives the font a bit more depth, and also added text-stroke to provide an outline around the text.

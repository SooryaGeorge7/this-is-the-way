# This is the Way

RESPONSIVE SITE IMAGE TO GO HERE

Team Livin' La Vida Yoda's Game entry for the May the Force be with you Code Institute Hackathon, May 2023.

'This Is The Way' is a one-player game for large screens (not currently available for mobile devices - Patience, my young Padawan!) You play Grogu from 'The Mandolorian', facing off against Jawas and collecting frogs before reuniting with The Mandolorian. Click 'Play Music' to get the full 'Mandolorian' experience!

This mechanics for this game were created using [Kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/).

* To be able to move Grogu intuitively through the map
* A fun and original game experience with Madolorian music and imagery
* Functionality to turn the music on/off

### DESIGN
We took inspiration for our color scheme from the planet Tatooine (specifically its iconic binary sunset!). Using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) we extracted a theme based on this image:

![Movie still from the movie Star Wars IV: A New Hope](/assets/images/syfy_image.jpg)

The following colors were selected:
- ![#8C6175](https://placehold.co/15x15/8C6175/8C6175.png) Purple 
- ![#40342d](https://placehold.co/15x15/40342d/40342d.png) Brown
- ![#ef554b](https://placehold.co/15x15/ef554b/ef554b.png) Orange
- ![#a6695b](https://placehold.co/15x15/a6695b/a6695b.png) Camel
- ![#a66868](https://placehold.co/15x15/a66868/a66868.png) Dusty Pink

We cross referenced the colors using [Eight Shapes](www.https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to test the contrast and made sure we used readable combinations throughout the website.

#### TYPOGRAPHY

The Mandalorian font is well recogised for its distinctive strong angles and cutout of the Mandalorian in the character A.

We sourced the font Mandalore from [dafonts](https://www.dafont.com/mandalore.font) and then converted the font to a WebFont Kit to allow the font to be used on our site using [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/).

To make the heading 'pop' we have styled it using the text-shadow attribute in the css which gives the font a bit more depth, and also added text-stroke to provide an outline around the text.

![Mandalore Font Preview](documentation/mandalore-font.png)

Space Mono is an original fixed-width type family designed by Colophon Foundry for Google Design. It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.

'Monospace' is the back-up font for this site.

#### IMAGERY

Imagery used throughout the site is based on Star Wars and the Mandalorian.

Grogu appears in his floating crib in the game.

As the game is based on the planet of Tattoine, the enemies chosen are the Jawa. (Alamite sprites were also created and may appear in future versions of the game)

Grogu's health boost is his favourite snack - a frog.

The Mandolorian who appears at the end of the level.

The background for the game was designed to reflect the inside of a sandcrawler vehicle.
